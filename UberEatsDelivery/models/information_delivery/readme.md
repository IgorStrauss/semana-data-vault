# Information Delivery Layer

## Overview
The Information Delivery layer transforms Data Vault structures into business-friendly formats for reporting and analytics. While AutomateDV focuses on Raw and Business Vault, Information Delivery typically uses standard SQL.

## Common Patterns

### 1. **One Big Table (OBT)**
Denormalized tables optimized for specific use cases:
```sql
-- Combines data from multiple vault objects
WITH order_base AS (
    SELECT FROM {{ ref('hub_order') }}
),
order_details AS (
    SELECT FROM {{ ref('sat_order_details') }}
),
-- Additional CTEs...
SELECT 
    -- Denormalized result set
FROM order_base
LEFT JOIN order_details...
```

**Benefits:**
- Simple for BI tools
- Fast query performance
- No complex joins for end users

### 2. **Dimensional Models**
Traditional star schemas built from Data Vault:

**Fact Tables:**
- Transaction-level grain
- Measures and metrics
- Foreign keys to dimensions

**Dimension Tables:**
- Descriptive attributes
- Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)
- Hierarchies and groupings

### 3. **Data Marts**
Subject-specific views combining PIT and Bridge tables:
```sql
-- Leverage PIT tables for performance
SELECT 
    p.*,
    sat1.attribute1,
    sat2.attribute2
FROM {{ ref('pit_order') }} p
JOIN {{ ref('sat_order_details') }} sat1 
    ON p.SAT_ORDER_DETAILS_PK = sat1.ORDER_HK
    AND p.SAT_ORDER_DETAILS_LDTS = sat1.LOAD_DTS
```

## Key Considerations

### Performance Optimization
1. **Use PIT/Bridge Tables**: Leverage Business Vault structures
2. **Materialization**: Use `table` for heavy queries
3. **Partitioning**: Partition large tables by date
4. **Indexes**: Add indexes for common query patterns

### Business Requirements
1. **User-Friendly Names**: Use business terminology
2. **Calculated Metrics**: Add derived measures
3. **Data Quality**: Apply final quality checks
4. **Security**: Implement row/column level security

### Common Transformations
- **Pivoting**: Transform rows to columns
- **Aggregations**: Summarize to required grain
- **Formatting**: Apply business formatting rules
- **Enrichment**: Add reference data

## Integration with BI Tools

### Tableau/Power BI
- Create certified data sources
- Document calculations
- Optimize for live connections

### SQL Access
- Create views for ad-hoc queries
- Document available tables
- Provide query examples

## Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with basic views, evolve as needed
2. **Document Everything**: Business rules, calculations, assumptions
3. **Version Control**: Track changes to business logic
4. **Performance Test**: Validate query performance at scale
5. **User Feedback**: Iterate based on user needs

## Relationship to Data Vault

Information Delivery is where Data Vault flexibility pays off:
- **Historical Analysis**: Use PIT tables for point-in-time reporting
- **Relationship Analysis**: Leverage Bridge tables for complex relationships
- **Audit Trail**: Full lineage back to source systems
- **Agility**: Add new sources without rebuilding

The Information Delivery layer translates the technical Data Vault model into business value, making the investment in proper Data Vault modeling worthwhile.
